Installation

Keyboard layout
For many countries and keyboard types appropriate keymaps are available already, and a command like loadkeys uk might do what you want. 
More available keymap files can be found in /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/ (you can omit the keymap path and file extension when using loadkeys).

Partition disks
cfdisk
mkfs

Mount the partitions
We now must mount the root partition on /mnt. 
You should also create directories for and mount any other partitions (/mnt/boot, /mnt/home, ...) 
and mount your swap partition if you want them to be detected by genfstab.

Connect to the internet
A DHCP service is already enabled for all available devices. 
If you need to setup a static IP or use management tools such as Netctl, you should stop this service first: 
systemctl stop dhcpcd.service. For more information read configuring network.

Wireless
Run wifi-menu to set up your wireless network. For details, see Wireless Setup and Netctl.

Install the base system
Before installing, you may want to edit /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist such that your preferred mirror is first. 
This copy of the mirrorlist will be installed on your new system by pacstrap as well, so it's worth getting it right.
Using the pacstrap script we install the base system.
# pacstrap /mnt base
Other packages can be installed by appending their names to the above command (space seperated), including the bootloader if you want.

Install a bootloader
GRUB
For BIOS:
# arch-chroot /mnt pacman -S grub-bios
For EFI (in rare cases you will need grub-efi-i386 instead):
# arch-chroot /mnt pacman -S grub-efi-x86_64
Syslinux
# arch-chroot /mnt pacman -S syslinux

Configure the system
Generate an fstab with the following command (if you prefer to use UUIDs or labels, add the -U or -L option, respectively):
# genfstab -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
Next we chroot into our newly installed system:
# arch-chroot /mnt
Write your hostname to /etc/hostname.
Symlink /etc/localtime to /usr/share/zoneinfo/Zone/SubZone. 
Replace Zone and Subzone to your liking. For example:
# ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Athens /etc/localtime
Uncomment the selected locale in /etc/locale.gen and generate it with locale-gen.
Set locale preferences in /etc/locale.conf. #LANG="en_US.UTF-8"

Add console keymap and font preferences in /etc/vconsole.conf #KEYMAP=us

Configure /etc/mkinitcpio.conf as needed and create an initial RAM disk with:
# mkinitcpio -p linux

Configure the bootloader.
# modprobe dm-mod
# grub-install --recheck /dev/sda
# grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Set a root password with passwd.

Unmount and reboot
